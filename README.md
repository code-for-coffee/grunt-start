# grunt-start
A little Grunt.js starter template

To get started, clone [the repo](https://github.com/poopsplat/grunt-start), navigate to the project folder and run `npm install` (might require `sudo` to run correctly). This will install all of the project dependencies. If you already have [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) installed on your machine (if you don't just run `npm install -g grunt-cli`), run `grunt` from the project folder to run the default taks, or run `grunt listen` to watch your project for changes that will trigger the tasks automatically!
